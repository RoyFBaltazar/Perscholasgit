    the world.I've been running for about 3 years. My dream
    is to run the <a href="https://www.nyrr.org/tcsnycmarathon">NYC Marathon</a>
    The crowd in NYC is amazing. As spectator the energy from crowd is electrifying,
    I can only imagine myself as a runner. Reading is another of my passions,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>
    is one of my favorite authors, I have read most of his novels. Traveling
    Europe is one of my goals. I have been learning French over the past
     years, speaking with natives speakers would improve my skills.
